# Minio
To connect Streamlit with Minio, you can use the minio library to interact with Minio server, and then use Streamlit to display the results.

Here is an example code snippet to get you started:

import streamlit as st
from minio import Minio
from minio.error import ResponseError

# Initialize Minio client
client = Minio(
    "minio_server_url",
    access_key="your_access_key",
    secret_key="your_secret_key",
    secure=False  # Set to True for secure (HTTPS) access
)

# List all the buckets in the Minio server
st.write("### Buckets:")
try:
    buckets = client.list_buckets()
    for bucket in buckets:
        st.write(f"- {bucket.name}")
except ResponseError as err:
    st.error(f"Minio error occurred: {err}")

# List all the objects in a bucket
bucket_name = st.text_input("Enter bucket name:")
if bucket_name:
    st.write(f"### Objects in bucket {bucket_name}:")
    try:
        objects = client.list_objects(bucket_name)
        for obj in objects:
            st.write(f"- {obj.object_name}")
    except ResponseError as err:
        st.error(f"Minio error occurred: {err}")

In this example, we initialize a Minio client with the server URL, access key, and secret key. We then list all the buckets in the Minio server and display them in Streamlit. We also provide an input field for the user to enter the name of a bucket. If a bucket name is provided, we list all the objects in that bucket and display them in Streamlit.

Note that you need to install the minio library to use this code snippet. You can install it using pip:

pip install minio
Also, make sure you have the correct access and secret keys to access your Minio server.
